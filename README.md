In the terminal, you should install Cypress via .npm
cd /your/project/path
npm install cypress --save-dev
This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.

Make sure that you have already run npm init or have a node_modules folder or package.json file in the root of your project to ensure cypress is installed in the correct directory.

To open cypress, write in your terminal: npx cypress open

When Cypress is opened click on e2e testing option, and then Google Chrome.

The test should be running.
